= Cloning Around =

== Classic Source Control ==

Copy your project to a directory in your main server. Initialize a Git
repository: <tt>git init ; git add . ; git commit -m "Initial commit"</tt>.

To check out source, a developer types

 $ git clone git+ssh://main.server/directory

After making changes, the code is checked in to the main server by:

 $ git commit -a
 $ git push

If the main server has been updated, the latest version needs to be checked out before the push. To sync to the latest version:

 $ git commit -a
 $ git pull

== Forking a Project ==

Sick of the way a project is being run? Think you could do a better job?

First, on your server:

 $ git clone git+ssh://main.server/directory

Then tell everyone to check out your fork of the project at your server.

At any later time, you can merge in the changes from the original project with:

 $ git pull

== Ultimate Backups ==

How would you like multiple tamper-proof geographically diverse redundant archives?
