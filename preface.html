<h1>Git Magic</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> is a version control Swiss army knife. The duct tape of source code management.

As Arthur C. Clarke observed, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. This is the case for newbies, who may as well view Git as a gizmo that can amaze friends and infuriate enemies with its wondrous abilities. So rather than go into details, I'll provide rough recipes for particular effects. After repeated use, gradually you will understand how each trick works, and how to tailor them for your needs.
