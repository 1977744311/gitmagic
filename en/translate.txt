== Appendix B: Translating This Guide ==

Clone the source, then create a directory corresponding to the target http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry[language's IETF tag]: see
http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/Overview.en.php[the W3C article on internationalization]. For example, English is "en", Japanese is "ja", and Traditional Chinese is "zh-Hant". In the new directory, and translate the +txt+ files from the "en" subdirectory. 

For instance, to translate the guide into http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language[Klingon], you might type:

 $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/gitmagic.git
 $ cd gitmagic
 $ mkdir tlh  # "tlh" is the IETF language code for Klingon.
 $ cd tlh
 $ cp ../en/intro.txt .
 $ edit intro.txt  # Translate the file.

and so on for each text file. You can review your work incrementally:

 $ make LANG=tlh
 $ firefox book.html

Commit your changes often, then let me know when they're ready.
GitHub.com has an interface that facilitates this: fork the "gitmagic" project,
push your changes, then ask me to merge.

I like to have translations follow the above scheme so my scripts can produce
HTML and PDF versions. Also, it conveniently keeps all the translations in the
official repository. But please do whatever suits you best: for example, the
Chinese translators used Google Docs. I'm happy as long as your work
enables more people to access my work.
